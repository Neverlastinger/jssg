#Milestone JavaScript Study Group.

This is the public space to find all resources and projects we work on during the JavaScript Study Group in Milestone Systems. The official book is [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html). We've also created the [Cosmic Encounter Score Board](http://neverlastinger.github.io/jssg/CosmicEncounterScoreBoard/).
